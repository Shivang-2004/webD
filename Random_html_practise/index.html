    <h4>Song Lyrics</h4>
    <pre>
        
        You said that you love me, but you told a lie
        Outside you're lovely, but I've seen inside
        And all of your friends told me
        Time wasn't right

        You go too slow, you stay so cold
        I speak my mind, you still say no

        It's blurry nights that haunt my mind
        Don't wanna find out, might just cry
        I might have tied myself up high
        And just let go, I'll touch the sky for you
        It's blurry nights I can't get through
        You told me lies I thought were true
        But I'll get over you

        Two things on my birthday
        I don't want a cake give me a sundae
        Where I don't think of getting hanged
        I don't wanna play just give one day
        Where I don't think of getting played
        I'm a sensitive guy with no touch√©
        I done fucked up, on my plate
        I got plenty of problems, It's too late

        It's blurry nights that haunt my mind
        Don't wanna find out, might just cry
        I might have tied myself up high
        And just let go, I'll touch the sky for you
        It's blurry nights I can't get through
        You told me lies I thought were true
        But I'll get over you

        You go too slow, you stay so cold
        I speak my mind, you still say no

        It's blurry nights that haunt my mind
        Don't wanna find out, might just cry
        I might have tied myself up high
        And just let go, I'll touch the sky for you
        It's blurry nights I can't get through
        You told me lies I thought were true
        But I'll get over you
